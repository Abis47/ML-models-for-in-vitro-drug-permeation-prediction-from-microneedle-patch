- The code file used in the research work is available here

## How to run the deployed model application
- Download all files in your local system
- If Python is installed directly in your system, open the Windows command prompt. If it is installed in an anaconda environment, use the anaconda prompt.
- Go to the folder where you have downloaded (for example, "cd /d C:\Users\user_name\Downloads\ml_mns_project").
- Now write "python app.py"
- A link will appear. You can either copy paste that link in any browser, or you can directly click on it holding the CTRL key on your keyboard.
- To close the app, exit the browser, open the command prompt where you have opened the app, and press CTRL + 'C'
